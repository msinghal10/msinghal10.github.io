Research Interests
======
My current research interest include social computing, data-driven fact checking, content moderation, data mining and algorithmic fairness and ethics. My research takes a highly interdisciplinary approach, integrating AI, NLP, social sciences, and ethics to address societal issues of social media and its broader implications. 

<!-- Currently I am working on algorithmic fairness of filtering tools employed by companies and ranking algorithm and examining how social media platforms moderate content and what are some of the key differences and also its impact on user discourse. Recent work includes detecting misinformation about security and privacy threats on social media.  -->
